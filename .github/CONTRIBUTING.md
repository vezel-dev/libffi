# Contributing

This repository is a fork that only makes build system changes and provides Zig
bindings. As such, most issues and pull requests should be directed
[upstream](https://github.com/libffi/libffi). That said, if your issue or pull
request is related to our fork's changes, then please see
[our organization contribution guide](https://github.com/vezel-dev/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please note that, if you send a pull request and it is merged, it is quite
likely that the record of your contribution will be lost, even though the change
itself is kept. This happens because we rebase the `master` branch periodically
and try to keep the number of commits on top of upstream to a minimum.

# Security

This repository is a fork that only makes build system changes and provides Zig
bindings. As such, most security issues should be directed
[upstream](https://github.com/libffi/libffi). That said, if you wish to report a
security issue that is related to our fork's changes, then please see
[our organization security policy](https://github.com/vezel-dev/.github/security/policy).
